A .NET Standard 2.0 library for reading PDF files.

## What works vs. doesn't work

- [x] Everything in regards to reading and parsing PDF files

It's important to note that this is **prerelease software**, meaning some things work while others do not.

If you come across a feature that you know should work (but doesn't), please submit an issue or pull request so we can slowly move towards a stable release.

## Usage

_TODO_

For now you can look at the unit tests for sample usage. Once this project matures, so will the documentation.
